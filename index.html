                        <h2>Where we are</h2>
						
						<p>
						Our location at Long Key makes it easy to fish the bayside or the oceanside. Leaving from our dock, you can be on the Atlantic oceanside in minutes by going under the Long Key Bridge.
						The oceanside provides a huge variety of species of fish to catch. The bayside has the gamefish - bonefish, permit, redfish or catch tarpon on either side of the Long Key Bridge.

                        <h2>Pontoon boats</h2>
						
						<p>
						Pontoon boat rentals from Pier 68 are lots of fun. We have several sizes to accommodate your budget and the number of people in your party. Boat rentals in the Florida Keys are mostly center console boats, which we also rent, but at Pier 68 we offer you an extra fun boat rental - a pontoon boat.
						Easy to get on and off, these pontoon boats have ladders, cushion seating, and canvas top for protection from the sun.
